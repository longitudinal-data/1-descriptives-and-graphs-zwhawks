# Bringing in the means

  # can fix intercepts, e.g. variable ~ 1
  # can specify 'meanstructure = TRUE' when fitting model
  # by default, sem() and cfa() fix latent variable intercepts to zero
  # In practice, the only reason why a user would add intercept-formulas in the model syntax, is because        some constraints must be specified on them. For example, suppose that we wish to fix the intercepts of      the variables x1, x2, x3 and x4 to, say, 0.5.
