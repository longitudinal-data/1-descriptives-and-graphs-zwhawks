development than I would like to admit. 101 seems to find her occasional odd behaviors (self pinching, banging head on wall) amusing. 101 is less adventurous than her twin. She sometimes seems apprehensive or scared to go down slides or stairs, even with encouragement, 102's example, or literal physical support; it is worth mentioning that 101 fell down our carpeted staircase at home once due to a guest forgetting to lock the gate. She sustained no injury- not even a bruise, but since 102 has not had the same misfortune I wonder if this fall may have something to do with her occasional anxiety. 101 seems to enjoy playing alone better than 102, but does play with her, other kids, and other adults frequently. 101 tends to be more obedient than 102, as well.
